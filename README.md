This Python program streamlines property and client management, offering a user-friendly interface for:

    Interactive Menu: Navigate through a clear menu of operations like displaying property/client information, adding new properties, updating existing properties, and generating reports.
    Modular Excel Handling: Utilize separate Excel files for properties and clients, leveraging classes for efficient data organization.
    Data Display: Easily view all property or client information directly from their respective Excel files.
    Property Addition: Effortlessly add new properties by providing details as user input, followed by seamless integration into the Excel file using to_excel.
    Value Update: Update specific values within the property Excel file by entering the row number, column name, and desired new value.
    Comprehensive Reports: Generate informative reports by combining data from various Excel files. The report identifies "available" properties and compiles information for each client, including their total income calculated by summing values from the "rent" column. This data is then meticulously organized and exported to a well-formatted PDF using the reportlab library.
